# Machine Learning X-Ray Analysis for Arthritis Evaluation

## Overview
Developed an advanced machine learning system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for automated X-ray analysis to assess arthritis extent in chronic patients, achieving over 95% accuracy while significantly reducing manual effort for healthcare professionals.

## Client
Healthcare Imaging Provider

## Business Challenge
Healthcare providers needed an automated solution to process large volumes of X-ray images for arthritis assessment in chronic patients. Manual analysis was time-consuming, prone to variability, and required significant radiologist time. The system needed to accurately identify regions of interest and classify arthritis severity across multiple anatomical areas.

## Solution
Built a comprehensive ML-powered imaging analysis system with automated region of interest (ROI) identification, Convolutional Neural Network models for arthritis classification, multi-level severity assessment (Normal, Moderate, Near End Stage, End Stage), support for multiple anatomical regions (knee medial/lateral, kneecap, pelvis), physician validation workflow, and integration with existing radiology systems.

## Outcomes
- 95%+ accuracy in arthritis classification across all regions
- Significant reduction in manual analysis time for radiologists
- Consistent and objective arthritis severity assessment
- Support for knee (medial & lateral), kneecap, and pelvis analysis
- Improved diagnostic workflow efficiency
- Enhanced patient care through faster diagnosis
