# International Atomic Energy Agency - Electronic Safety Standards Platform

## Overview
Streamlined and simplified the process of creating and maintaining the collection of documentation related to Nuclear Safety Standards (NSS) for the International Atomic Energy Agency.

## Client
**International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)**
- Industry: Government/Nuclear Safety
- Project Type: Product Engineering

## Business Challenge
The manual document creation and publishing process lacked collaboration, version control, and modular review capabilities, leading to inefficiencies and inconsistencies. The absence of integration between safety standards and a centralized repository resulted in difficulty tracking revisions and missing key publications.

## Solution
- **Secure Platform**: Audit-cleared platform designed per IAEA guidelines with centralized governance and user-friendly, collaborative publishing and review capabilities
- **Standardized Publishing**: Configurable publishing system with consistent styling, formatting, and workflow-based revisions
- **Scalable Architecture**: Solution adopted by NS and NE tenants with strong reporting engine and more tenants onboarding
- **Security Compliance**: Designed according to stringent IAEA security guidelines

## Technologies Used
