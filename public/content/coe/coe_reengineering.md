# Technology Modernization & Application Reengineering Center of Excellence

## Overview

Accion's Application Reengineering Center of Excellence specializes in transforming legacy monolithic applications into modern, scalable digital platforms using innovative engineering principles. The CoE provides comprehensive reengineering services that help organizations overcome the challenges of legacy systems and embrace modern, cloud-native architectures.

## Key Focus Areas

### Legacy System Transformation

The CoE addresses the fundamental challenge of transforming "Built to Last" legacy systems into "Built for Change" modern platforms:

**From Legacy (Built to Last):**
- Large, monolithic silo applications & infrastructure
- High time and cost to add new features
- Manual, waterfall development process
- High technical debt

**To Modern (Built for Change):**
- Integrated platform composed of loosely coupled, containerized microservices
- Automated, agile development process
- Fast and cheap to add new features
- Low technical debt

## Core Capabilities

### Reengineering Work Streams

The CoE executes multiple parallel work streams for comprehensive modernization:

1. **Legacy UI to Digital Experiences**
   - Transform outdated user interfaces into modern, responsive digital experiences
   - Implement adaptive UI/UX engineering principles
   - Mobile-first design approach

2. **Monolithic to Microservices**
   - Decompose monolithic applications into loosely coupled microservices
   - Implement containerized architectures
   - Enable independent service deployment and scaling

3. **Transactional to Big Data**
   - Migrate from traditional transactional systems to big data analytics platforms
   - Implement data lakes and real-time analytics capabilities
   - Integrate AI/ML for predictive insights

4. **Servers to Containers on Cloud**
   - Modernize infrastructure from traditional servers to cloud-native containers
   - Implement auto-scaling and high availability architectures
   - Optimize for cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)

5. **Waterfall to CI/CD Automation**
   - Transform manual, waterfall development processes
   - Implement automated CI/CD pipelines
   - Enable continuous integration and deployment

## Reengineering Approaches

The CoE employs four distinct approaches based on project requirements:

### 1. Tech Debt Addressal
Incremental improvements to existing codebase while maintaining current functionality.

### 2. Parallel Development & Integration
Develop new components in parallel with legacy systems, gradually integrating modern features.

### 3. Incremental Value Delivery
Implement new features incrementally, delivering business value at each stage.

### 4. Module by Module (Greenfield)
Complete rewrite of individual modules using modern technologies and architectures.
