  "industry": "Healthcare",
  "description": "Built an advanced care management platform using OCR, NLP, and machine learning to help healthcare payers transition from traditional fee-for-service to risk-adjusted value-based care plans, achieving 15-20% improvement in Risk Adjustment Factor (RAF) and 19x return on investment.",
  "challenge": "Healthcare payers needed to transition from traditional 'one size fits all' benefit plans to personalized, risk-adjusted value-based care models. This required analyzing massive volumes of unstructured clinical data from various sources including clinical progress notes, electronic prescriptions, and handwritten notes to build accurate patient risk profiles.",
  "solution": "Developed a comprehensive AI-powered platform with OCR and NLP capabilities for document processing, machine learning pipelines for text-to-clinical-code mapping, semantic text to concept mapping systems, patient risk profile generation using clinical code combinations, ML algorithms for personalized benefit plan engagement, and automated taxonomy concept binding.",
  "outcomes": [
    "15-20% improvement in Risk Adjustment Factor (RAF) for client customers",
    "19x return on investment through improved risk assessment",
    "Successful transition from manual to automated risk profiling",
    "Enhanced accuracy in patient risk stratification",
