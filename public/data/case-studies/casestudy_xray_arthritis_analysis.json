  "description": "Developed an advanced machine learning system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for automated X-ray analysis to assess arthritis extent in chronic patients, achieving over 95% accuracy while significantly reducing manual effort for healthcare professionals.",
  "challenge": "Healthcare providers needed an automated solution to process large volumes of X-ray images for arthritis assessment in chronic patients. Manual analysis was time-consuming, prone to variability, and required significant radiologist time. The system needed to accurately identify regions of interest and classify arthritis severity across multiple anatomical areas.",
  "solution": "Built a comprehensive ML-powered imaging analysis system with automated region of interest (ROI) identification, Convolutional Neural Network models for arthritis classification, multi-level severity assessment (Normal, Moderate, Near End Stage, End Stage), support for multiple anatomical regions (knee medial/lateral, kneecap, pelvis), physician validation workflow, and integration with existing radiology systems.",
  "outcomes": [
    "95%+ accuracy in arthritis classification across all regions",
    "Significant reduction in manual analysis time for radiologists",
    "Consistent and objective arthritis severity assessment",
    "Support for knee (medial & lateral), kneecap, and pelvis analysis",
    "Improved diagnostic workflow efficiency",
    "Enhanced patient care through faster diagnosis"
