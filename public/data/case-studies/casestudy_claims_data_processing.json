  "description": "Developed an advanced claims processing system for a multi-billion dollar PBM to merge acquired platforms, enhance benefits plan management, and improve patient experience using big data analytics and machine learning, processing 100 million transactions with 250+ parameter fields.",
  "challenge": "A major PBM needed to merge a recently acquired claims adjudication platform while ensuring consistency in claims processing and enhancing benefits plan management to improve patient experience and auto-adjudication rates. The system required processing massive transaction volumes with complex data analysis and anomaly detection.",
  "solution": "Built a comprehensive claims processing platform using big data analytics blended with high-speed comparison ML algorithms for real-time claims processing and mismatch detection, optimized benefits plan configuration and recommendation engines, advanced feature selection and machine learning techniques, data clustering using unsupervised learning, and automated anomaly detection systems.",
  "outcomes": [
    "200% improvement in identifying clusters of similar claims with issues",
    "50% reduction in OPEX associated with parallel testing and customer onboarding",
    "80% reduction in rework for testing teams",
    "100 million transactions processed for certification testing and ML analytics",
