# Breeze.AI - AI-Driven SDLC Transformation Platform

## Overview

Breeze.AI is Accion Labs' next-generation AI-powered software development lifecycle (SDLC) transformation platform that leverages semantic engineering and intelligent agents to minimize the Manual Translation Tax. By automating the translation from business intent to implementation, Breeze.AI delivers 30% acceleration in development with less than 2% defect rate and includes a 90-day quality warranty.

## Core Concept: Semantic Engineering

### The Problem Breeze.AI Solves
Traditional software development suffers from the **Manual Translation Tax** - the loss of context and efficiency that occurs when:
- Requirements are manually translated to design
- Design is manually translated to code
- Code is manually validated against requirements
- Context is lost at each handoff point

### The Breeze.AI Solution
Breeze.AI replaces manual handoffs with intelligent automation while maintaining human control through:
- **Unified Model**: Business knowledge in AI-readable format
- **Custom Agents**: Specialized AI for each development phase
- **Human Validation**: Teams stay in control of the process
- **Context Preservation**: Semantic models maintain intent throughout

## Architecture Components

### 1. Semantic Model Intelligence
- **Engineering Ontologies**: Foundation for understanding business domains
- **Application Semantic Models**: AI-readable representation of business logic
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains business intent through all phases
- **Continuous Learning**: Models improve with usage

### 2. Engineering Agents Framework
Breeze.AI employs two categories of specialized agents:

#### Engineering Agents
- **Functional Agents**: Requirements analysis and specification
