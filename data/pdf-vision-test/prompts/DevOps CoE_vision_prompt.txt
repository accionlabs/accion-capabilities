AI Based SRE Agent:  Kubernetes Anomaly Deduction and Log analysis
Proprietary anomaly detection engine : Developed by Accion 
DevOps COE , Monitors logs, metrics, API activity, pod lifecycle 
events, and network flows in real time to detect deviations (e.g. 
CPU spike, off-hour resource surge, failed logins followed by new 
IP access)
ML model validation:  Tested on >30,000 Kubernetes datapoints 
over ~10hours; compared approaches including Isolation Forest, 
One-Class SVM, DBSCAN, traditional autoencoders
