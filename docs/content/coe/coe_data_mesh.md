- Federated governance with computational enforcement
- Mesh architecture enabling cross-domain collaboration

## Getting Started

### Assessment Phase
1. **Current state analysis** of data architecture and ownership
2. **Platform readiness evaluation** across existing technology stack
3. **Domain identification** based on business capabilities
4. **Governance maturity assessment** for federated model readiness

### Implementation Approach
1. **Pilot domain selection** for initial Data Mesh implementation
2. **Platform foundation** setup with self-service capabilities
3. **Governance framework** establishment with policy automation
4. **Cross-domain integration** patterns and best practices
5. **Scaling strategy** for organization-wide adoption

The Data Mesh CoE enables organizations to transform their data architecture from centralized bottlenecks to decentralized, domain-driven ecosystems that scale with business growth while maintaining quality, governance, and compliance standards.
