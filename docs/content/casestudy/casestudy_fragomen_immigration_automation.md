# Immigration Application Automation - Fragomen

## Client Overview

**Fragomen** is one of the largest immigration services organizations globally, providing comprehensive immigration solutions to corporations and individuals worldwide. With a complex portfolio of visa processing services, the organization handles thousands of applications across multiple jurisdictions and immigration systems.

## Business Challenge

### The Problem
Fragomen faced significant challenges in their visa filing process that were impacting both efficiency and accuracy:

- **Manual Data Entry**: Users were manually taking data from their in-house application and entering it into various Government Immigration Application websites
- **Human Error Risk**: Repetitive manual tasks led to fatigue-induced errors, potentially affecting application approvals
- **Processing Delays**: Time-consuming manual processes created bottlenecks, especially during high-volume periods
- **Inconsistent Formats**: Multiple input files in varying formats from different staff members required manual standardization
- **Ad-hoc Processing**: Unattended processes were triggered manually without predefined schedules

### Impact on Business
- Increased risk of application rejections due to data entry errors
- Reduced processing capacity during peak immigration periods  
- Higher operational costs due to manual labor requirements
- Compliance risks from inconsistent data handling
- Limited scalability for business growth
