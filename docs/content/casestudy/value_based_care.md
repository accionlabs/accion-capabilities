# Care Management Platform for Value-Based Care Transition

## Overview
Built an advanced care management platform using OCR, NLP, and machine learning to help healthcare payers transition from traditional fee-for-service to risk-adjusted value-based care plans, achieving 15-20% improvement in Risk Adjustment Factor (RAF) and 19x return on investment.

## Client
Healthcare Payer

## Business Challenge
Healthcare payers needed to transition from traditional 'one size fits all' benefit plans to personalized, risk-adjusted value-based care models. This required analyzing massive volumes of unstructured clinical data from various sources including clinical progress notes, electronic prescriptions, and handwritten notes to build accurate patient risk profiles.

## Solution
Developed a comprehensive AI-powered platform with OCR and NLP capabilities for document processing, machine learning pipelines for text-to-clinical-code mapping, semantic text to concept mapping systems, patient risk profile generation using clinical code combinations, ML algorithms for personalized benefit plan engagement, and automated taxonomy concept binding.

## Outcomes
- 15-20% improvement in Risk Adjustment Factor (RAF) for client customers
- 19x return on investment through improved risk assessment
- Successful transition from manual to automated risk profiling
- Enhanced accuracy in patient risk stratification
- Personalized benefit plan optimization
- Significant reduction in administrative overhead
