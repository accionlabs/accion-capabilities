# Change Data Capture Tools

## Overview
Change Data Capture (CDC) Tools provide real-time data synchronization and event processing with minimal system impact. This component enables real-time data integration and system decoupling for modern architectures while maintaining data consistency across distributed systems.

## Core Capabilities

### Real-time Data Synchronization
- Near real-time change capture and propagation
- Low-latency data replication
- Event-driven architecture support
- Minimal impact on source systems

### Event Processing
- Change event enrichment and transformation
- Event routing and distribution
- Event ordering and deduplication
- Failure handling and retry logic

### System Integration
- Database-agnostic CDC implementation
- Message queue integration
- API-based change propagation
- Batch and streaming mode support

## CDC Patterns

### Log-based CDC
- Read database transaction logs
- Capture all changes without impacting source
- Guaranteed change capture
- Low latency and high throughput

### Trigger-based CDC
- Database triggers capture changes
- Flexible transformation capabilities
- Custom business logic integration
- Higher source system impact

### Query-based CDC
- Periodic queries for changed records
- Works with any database system
- Higher latency but simple implementation
- Good for systems without log access

## Data Consistency Strategies

### At-Least-Once Delivery
- Guaranteed message delivery
- Possible duplicate processing
- Idempotent consumer design required

### Exactly-Once Processing
