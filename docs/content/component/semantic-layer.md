# Semantic Layer - Unified Data Access APIs

## Overview
The Semantic Layer component provides a business-friendly data access layer with consistent metrics and unified APIs. This component enables organizations to democratize data access while maintaining data governance and ensuring consistent definitions across the enterprise.

## Core Capabilities

### Unified Data Access
- Single point of access for all enterprise data
- Business-friendly query interfaces
- Consistent metric definitions and calculations
- Self-service analytics enablement

### API Management
- RESTful API generation and management
- GraphQL support for flexible querying
- Authentication and authorization controls
- Rate limiting and performance optimization

### Data Virtualization
- Real-time data federation across sources
- Cache management for performance
- Query optimization and routing
- Data lineage and impact analysis

### Discovery Phase (2-3 weeks)
1. Data landscape assessment
2. Business requirements gathering
3. Metric inventory and standardization
4. Architecture design and planning

### Development Phase (6-10 weeks)
1. Semantic layer setup and configuration
2. Data source connections and mapping
3. API development and testing
4. Security implementation

### Rollout Phase (4-6 weeks)
1. User training and enablement
2. Dashboard and report migration
3. Performance monitoring setup
4. Support and optimization
