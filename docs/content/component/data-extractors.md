# Data Extractors - RDBMS and Flat File Connectors

## Overview
The Data Extractors component provides automated data extraction capabilities with format normalization and quality validation. This reusable component significantly reduces manual data processing while improving accuracy and standardizing output formats across diverse data sources.

## Core Capabilities

### Automated Data Extraction
- RDBMS connectivity and data extraction
- Flat file processing and parsing
- Multi-format support (CSV, XML, JSON, etc.)
- Batch and real-time extraction modes

### Format Normalization
- Standardized output format generation
- Data type conversion and validation
- Schema mapping and transformation
- Consistent data structure enforcement

### Quality Validation
- Data quality checks and validation rules
- Error detection and reporting
- Data profiling and analysis
- Compliance verification
